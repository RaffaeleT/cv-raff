This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Streaming CV video from Azure Blob Storage

Set either `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIDEO_SAS_URL` or `NEXT_VIDEO_BLOB_SAS_URL` (for example in `.env.local`) to the full Azure Blob SAS URL that serves the CV video. When one of these values is present the site will render an HTML `<video>` element, without committing the SAS token to the repository, right after the LinkedIn link in the CV.
